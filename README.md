# Mapping Earthquakes

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API, then create and explore interactive maps of earthquakes around the world.
The earthquake data is represented on the maps in relation to the tectonic plates that are located within the Earth, as well as in relation to each event's magnitude.

## Results

For the map to be interactive, an API key had to be obtained by visiting mapbox.com, creating a Mapbox account, then retrieving the access token which is used within the code to deploy the webpage. Click the link below to deploy to the interactive webpage:
